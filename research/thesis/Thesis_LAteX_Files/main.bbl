    This work introduces recent supervised machine learning methods such as
  Gaussian process regression and support vector machines for control of active
  prosthetic devices and forms a supervisory controller that infers the user's
  intent. In recent years active prosthetic devices emerged as research area.
  In comparison to passive devices, active ones mimic the motion of our intact
  limbs more perfectly. Hence, they overcome several drawbacks a user of a
  passive devices is confronted with. Examples for benefits caused by switching
  from a passive to an active prosthesis are a more normal gait and reduced
  metabolic costs of transport. Even though active devices can improve
  amputee's every day life, there are still challenges to be solved. Prosthesis
  control is besides design one of those challenges. The controller needs to
  decide when and how to adapt active support. Regarding, for instance, the
  push off phase, the active push off must be aligned with the timing and
  strength intended by the user. This work introduces recent supervised machine
  learning methods such as Gaussian process regression and support vector
  machines for control of active prosthetic devices. The machine learning
  methods are used to form a supervisory controller that infers the user's
  intent. As input to the supervisory controller, we use the data obtained by
  an inertial measurement unit mounted at the shank of the considered active
  ankle prosthesis. The output or rather the users intent is given by gait,
  speed and gait percent predictions. If the intent is known, the desired nut
  position can be determined by a lookup. To enforce the desired trajectory a
  slave controller, here a PD controller, is applied. The supervisory
  controller is designed, implemented and tested based on walking and running
  data recorded on a treadmill. At first, noise free motion capturing data is
  used to demonstrate the applicability of supervised machine learning methods
  in context of active ankle control. Afterwards, sensor data obtained with the
  prosthesis's intertial-measuremt unit is used to proof real-world
  applicability of the introduced supervisory controller. The obtained
  supervisory controller is fast and moreover accurate. For gait percent
  prediction the error is bounded to $\pm$5{\%}. In case of speed and gait
  prediction, accuracies close to 100{\%} and 95{\%} are achieved,
  respectively.%

    Haptic exoskeleton gloves are a widespread solution for providing
  force-feedback in Virtual Reality (VR), especially for 3D object
  manipulations. However, they are still lacking an important feature regarding
  in-hand haptic sensations: the palmar contact. In this paper, we present
  PalmEx, a novel approach which incorporates palmar force-feedback into
  exoskeleton gloves to improve the overall grasping sensations and manual
  haptic interactions in VR. PalmEx's concept is demonstrated through a
  self-contained hardware system augmenting a hand exoskeleton with an
  encountered palmar contact interface - physically encountering the users'
  palm. We build upon current taxonomies to elicit PalmEx's capabilities for
  both the exploration and manipulation of virtual objects. We first conduct a
  technical evaluation optimising the delay between the virtual interactions
  and their physical counterparts. We then empirically evaluate PalmEx's
  proposed design space in a user study (n=12) to assess the potential of a
  palmar contact for augmenting an exoskeleton. Results show that PalmEx offers
  the best rendering capabilities to perform believable grasps in VR. PalmEx
  highlights the importance of the palmar stimulation, and provides a low-cost
  solution to augment existing high-end consumer hand exoskeletons.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    The increased use of gait analysis has raised the need for a better
  understanding of how walking speed and demographic variations influence
  asymptomatic gait. Previous analyses mainly reported relationships between
  subsets of gait features and demographic measures, rendering it difficult to
  assess whether gait features are affected by walking speed or other
  demographic measures. The purpose of this study was to conduct a
  comprehensive analysis of the kinematic and kinetic profiles during
  ambulation that tests for the effect of walking speed in parallel to the
  effects of age, sex, and body mass index. This was accomplished by recruiting
  a population of 121 asymptomatic subjects and analyzing characteristic
  3-dimensional kinematic and kinetic features at the ankle, knee, hip, and
  pelvis during walking trials at slow, normal, and fast speeds. Mixed effects
  linear regression models were used to identify how each of 78 discrete gait
  features is affected by variations in walking speed, age, sex, and body mass
  index. As expected, nearly every feature was associated with variations in
  walking speed. Several features were also affected by variations in
  demographic measures, including age affecting sagittal-plane knee kinematics,
  body mass index affecting sagittal-plane pelvis and hip kinematics, body mass
  index affecting frontal-plane knee kinematics and kinetics, and sex affecting
  frontal-plane kinematics at the pelvis, hip, and knee. These results could
  aid in the design of future studies, as well as clarify how walking speed,
  age, sex, and body mass index may act as potential confounders in studies
  with small populations or in populations with insufficient demographic
  variations for thorough statistical analyses.%

    We introduce the {\textquotedbl}exponential linear unit{\textquotedbl}
  (ELU) which speeds up learning in deep neural networks and leads to higher
  classification accuracies. Like rectified linear units (ReLUs), leaky ReLUs
  (LReLUs) and parametrized ReLUs (PReLUs), ELUs alleviate the vanishing
  gradient problem via the identity for positive values. However, ELUs have
  improved learning characteristics compared to the units with other activation
  functions. In contrast to ReLUs, ELUs have negative values which allows them
  to push mean unit activations closer to zero like batch normalization but
  with lower computational complexity. Mean shifts toward zero speed up
  learning by bringing the normal gradient closer to the unit natural gradient
  because of a reduced bias shift effect. While LReLUs and PReLUs have negative
  values, too, they do not ensure a noise-robust deactivation state. ELUs
  saturate to a negative value with smaller inputs and thereby decrease the
  forward propagated variation and information. Therefore, ELUs code the degree
  of presence of particular phenomena in the input, while they do not
  quantitatively model the degree of their absence. In experiments, ELUs lead
  not only to faster learning, but also to significantly better generalization
  performance than ReLUs and LReLUs on networks with more than 5 layers. On
  CIFAR-100 ELUs networks significantly outperform ReLU networks with batch
  normalization while batch normalization does not improve ELU networks. ELU
  networks are among the top 10 reported CIFAR-10 results and yield the best
  published result on CIFAR-100, without resorting to multi-view evaluation or
  model averaging. On ImageNet, ELU networks considerably speed up learning
  compared to a ReLU network with the same architecture, obtaining less than
  10{\%} classification error for a single crop, single model network.%

    Lower limb amputations impair normal locomotion. This calls for the use of
  prosthetic devices to restore the lost or disabled functionality. Most of the

  locomotive intention to produce the required locomotion similar to that of an
  able-bodied individual. For individuals with transtibial amputation, the
  control algorithm should produce the desired locomotion by controlling an
  active ankle joint to generate appropriate ankle angle and ankle moment. In
  this paper, a strategy is proposed for the continuous estimation of ankle
  angle and ankle moment during walking using a support vector regression
  approach. Experimentally obtained hip and knee joint motion data were
  provided as the inputs to the support vector regression model. It is shown
  that, for level ground walking at self-selected speed, the proposed method
  could predict the ankle angle and moment with high accuracy (mean R2 value of
  0.98 for ankle angle and 0.97 for ankle moment).%

    Human gait is the result of a complex and fascinating cooperation between
  different joints and segments in the lower extremity. This study aims at
  investigating the existence of this cooperation or the so-called synergy
  between the shank motion and the ankle motion. One potential use of this
  synergy is to develop the high level controllers for active foot
  prostheses/orthoses. The central point in this paper is to develop a high
  level controller that is able to continuously map shank kinematics (inputs)
  to ankle angles and torques (outputs). At the same time, it does not require
  speed determination, gait percent identification, switching rules, and
  look-up tables. Furthermore, having those targets in mind, an important part
  of this study is to determine which input type is required to achieve such
  targets. This should be fulfilled through using minimum number of inputs. To
  do this, the Gaussian process (GP) regression has been used to estimate the
  ankle angles and torques for 11 subjects at three walking speeds (0.5, 1, and
  1.5 m/s) based on the shank angular velocity and angle. The results show that
  it is possible to estimate ankle motion based on the shank motion. It was
  found that the estimation achieved less quality with only shank angular
  velocity or angle, whereas the aggregated angular velocity and angle resulted
  in much higher output estimation quality. In addition, the estimation quality
  was acceptable for the speeds that there was a training procedure before and
  when it was tested for the untrained speeds, the estimation quality was not
  as acceptable as before. The pros and cons of the proposed method are
  investigated at different scenarios.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    To reinstate human-like locomotion by using robotic prosthetics, orthotics
  or exoskeletons, a main challenge is how to coordinate the motion of these
  devices with that of the biological limbs. One approach to overcome this
  challenge is to identify firstly the relationships that exist between the
  kinematics and kinetics of the lower extremity joints and limbs. In this work
  we aimed to continuously estimate sagittal plane ankle, knee and hip moments
  using shank or thigh angles. For this purpose, neural network and wavelets
  were used in a nonlinear auto-regressive model with exogenous inputs. This
  approach circumvented the need for switching rules or intermediate
  parameters. To assess the performance of the estimator, four case studies
  were developed. First, thigh angles (inputs) were used to estimate hip
  moments (outputs). Second, thigh angles were used to estimate knee moments.
  Third, ankle moments were estimated using thigh angles, and in the fourth
  case study, ankle moments were estimated using shank angles. Three different
  databases involving 106 subjects at different walking speeds were used to
  evaluate estimation quality. The testing procedure involved both
  inter-subject and intra-subject evaluations. The best estimation performance
  was observed when ankle moments were estimated from shank angles. The weakest
  estimation performance was observed when knee moments were estimated using
  thigh angles at 0.5 m/s. For this case, the estimation quality was much
  better at 1.5 m/s. Average RMS errors were 0.13- 0.15, 0.10- 0.13, and 0.09-
  0.12 [Nm/kg] for hip, knee and ankle moments, respectively. Average mean
  absolute errors MAEs were 0.10- 0.11, 0.07- 0.10, and 0.06- 0.08 [Nm/kg] for
  hip, knee and ankle moments, respectively. Average correlation coefficients
  were 0.90- 0.98 and 0.98- 0.99 for hip and ankle moment estimations. The
  value for knee was comparable only at high speed (0.96 for 1.5 m/s), while it
  was less accurate at slow speed (0.71 for 0.5 m/s). In general, for all of
  the joints, the estimation accuracy was comparable with that of other
  studies, although one source of input was employed (either shank or thigh
  angle).%

    OBJECTIVE Powered robotic prostheses create a need for natural-feeling user
  interfaces and robust control schemes. Here, we examined the ability of a
  nonlinear autoregressive model to continuously map the kinematics of a
  transtibial prosthesis and electromyographic (EMG) activity recorded within
  socket to the future estimates of the prosthetic ankle angle in three
  transtibial amputees. APPROACH Model performance was examined across subjects
  during level treadmill ambulation as a function of the size of the EMG
  sampling window and the temporal 'prediction' interval between the
  EMG/kinematic input and the model's estimate of future ankle angle to
  characterize the trade-off between model error, sampling window and
  prediction interval. MAIN RESULT Across subjects, deviations in the estimated
  ankle angle from the actual movement were robust to variations in the EMG
  sampling window and increased systematically with prediction interval. For
  prediction intervals up to 150 ms, the average error in the model estimate of
  ankle angle across the gait cycle was less than 6°. EMG contributions to the
  model prediction varied across subjects but were consistently localized to
  the transitions to/from single to double limb support and captured variations
  from the typical ankle kinematics during level walking. SIGNIFICANCE The use
  of an autoregressive modeling approach to continuously predict joint
  kinematics using natural residual muscle activity provides opportunities for
  direct (transparent) control of a prosthetic joint by the user. The model's
  predictive capability could prove particularly useful for overcoming delays
  in signal processing and actuation of the prosthesis, providing a more
  biomimetic ankle response.%

    In a typical clinical gait analysis, the gait patterns of pathological
  individuals are commonly compared with the typically faster, comfortable pace
  of healthy subjects. However, due to potential bias related to gait speed,
  this comparison may not be valid. Publicly available gait datasets have
  failed to address this issue. Therefore, the goal of this study was to
  present a publicly available dataset of 42 healthy volunteers (24 young
  adults and 18 older adults) who walked both overground and on a treadmill at
  a range of gait speeds. Their lower-extremity and pelvis kinematics were
  measured using a three-dimensional (3D) motion-capture system. The external
  forces during both overground and treadmill walking were collected using
  force plates and an instrumented treadmill, respectively. The results include
  both raw and processed kinematic and kinetic data in different file formats:
  c3d and ASCII files. In addition, a metadata file is provided that contain
  demographic and anthropometric data and data related to each file in the
  dataset. All data are available at Figshare (DOI:
  10.6084/m9.figshare.5722711). We foresee several applications of this public
  dataset, including to examine the influences of speed, age, and environment
  (overground vs. treadmill) on gait biomechanics, to meet educational needs,
  and, with the inclusion of additional participants, to use as a normative
  dataset.%

    Deep learning tools have gained tremendous attention in applied machine
  learning. However such tools for regression and classification do not capture
  model uncertainty. In comparison, Bayesian models offer a mathematically
  grounded framework to reason about model uncertainty, but usually come with a
  prohibitive computational cost. In this paper we develop a new theoretical
  framework casting dropout training in deep neural networks (NNs) as
  approximate Bayesian inference in deep Gaussian processes. A direct result of
  this theory gives us tools to model uncertainty with dropout NNs --
  extracting information from existing models that has been thrown away so far.
  This mitigates the problem of representing uncertainty in deep learning
  without sacrificing either computational complexity or test accuracy. We
  perform an extensive study of the properties of dropout's uncertainty.
  Various network architectures and non-linearities are assessed on tasks of
  regression and classification, using MNIST as an example. We show a
  considerable improvement in predictive log-likelihood and RMSE compared to
  existing state-of-the-art methods, and finish by using dropout's uncertainty
  in deep reinforcement learning.%

    Work-related Musculoskeletal Disorders (WMSDs) account for a significant
  portion of worker illnesses and injuries, resulting in high costs and
  productivity losses to employers globally. In recent years, there has been an
  increased interest in the use of exoskeleton technology to reduce rates of
  WMSDs in industrial worksites. Despite the potential of exoskeletons to
  mitigate the risks of WMSDs, the required steps to properly assess and
  implement the technology for industrial applications are not clear. This
  paper proposes a framework that can help organizations successfully evaluate
  and adopt industrial exoskeletons. Through a focus group of industry
  professionals, researchers, and exoskeleton experts, and by building on
  existing literature, an overarching adoption framework is developed. The
  identified stages and tasks within the framework enable an organization to
  evaluate and adopt exoskeletons through a systematic approach and to identify
  the existing gaps in their technology adoption process. The findings also
  highlight the areas where further studies are needed to promote the adoption
  of industrial exoskeletons, including large-scale field studies and long-term
  monitoring.%

    Several variants of the long short-term memory (LSTM) architecture for
  recurrent neural networks have been proposed since its inception in 1995. In
  recent years, these networks have become the state-of-the-art models for a
  variety of machine learning problems. This has led to a renewed interest in
  understanding the role and utility of various computational components of
  typical LSTM variants. In this paper, we present the first large-scale
  analysis of eight LSTM variants on three representative tasks: speech
  recognition, handwriting recognition, and polyphonic music modeling. The
  hyperparameters of all LSTM variants for each task were optimized separately
  using random search, and their importance was assessed using the powerful
  functional ANalysis Of VAriance framework. In total, we summarize the results
  of 5400 experimental runs ( $\approx$ 15 years of CPU time), which makes our
  study the largest of its kind on LSTM networks. Our results show that none of
  the variants can improve upon the standard LSTM architecture significantly,
  and demonstrate the forget gate and the output activation function to be its
  most critical components. We further observe that the studied hyperparameters
  are virtually independent and derive guidelines for their efficient
  adjustment.%

    Rectified activation units (rectifiers) are essential for state-of-the-art
  neural networks. In this work, we study rectifier neural networks for image
  classification from two aspects. First, we propose a Parametric Rectified
  Linear Unit (PReLU) that generalizes the traditional rectified unit. PReLU
  improves model fitting with nearly zero extra computational cost and little
  overfitting risk. Second, we derive a robust initialization method that
  particularly considers the rectifier nonlinearities. This method enables us
  to train extremely deep rectified models directly from scratch and to
  investigate deeper or wider network architectures. Based on our PReLU
  networks (PReLU-nets), we achieve 4.94{\%} top-5 test error on the ImageNet
  2012 classification dataset. This is a 26{\%} relative improvement over the
  ILSVRC 2014 winner (GoogLeNet, 6.66{\%}). To our knowledge, our result is the
  first to surpass human-level performance (5.1{\%}, Russakovsky et al.) on
  this visual recognition challenge.%

    High-dimensional data can be converted to low-dimensional codes by training

    Prosthetic discrete controller relies on finite state machines to switch
  between a set of predefined task-specific controllers. Therefore the
  prosthesis can only perform a limited number of discrete locomotion tasks and
  need hours to tune the parameters for each user. In contrast, the continuous
  controller treats a gait cycle in a unified way. Thus it is expected to
  better facilitate normative biomechanics by providing a gait predictive model
  to contribute a non-switching controller that supports a continuum of tasks.
  Furthermore, a better method is to train a personalized trajectory prediction
  model suitable for personal characteristics according to personal walking
  data. This paper proposes a Gaussian process enhanced Fourier series (GPEFS)
  method to construct a gait prediction model that represents the human
  locomotion as a continuous function of phase, speed and slope. Firstly the
  joint trajectories are transformed into the Fourier coefficient space by
  least square method. Then the relationship between each Fourier coefficient
  and task input can be learned by multiple Gaussian process regression (GPRs)
  model respectively. Compared with directly using GPR to fit the joint
  trajectory under multi task, our method greatly reduces the computational
  burden, so as to meet the real-time application scenario. In addition, in
  Fourier coefficient space, the difference in all tasks between the Fourier
  coefficient of personal data and the one of statistical data follows the same
  trend. Therefore, a personalized prediction model is built to predict an
  individual's kinematics over a continuous range of slopes and speeds given
  only one personalized task at level ground and normal speed. The experimental
  results show that the gait prediction model and the personalized prediction
  model are feasible and effective.%

    This review focuses on control strategies for robotic ankle systems in
  active and semiactive lower-limb orthoses, prostheses, and exoskeletons.
  Special attention is paid to algorithms for gait phase identification,
  adaptation to different walking conditions, and motion intention recognition.
  The relevant aspects of hardware configuration and hardware-level controllers
  are discussed as well. Control algorithms proposed for other actuated
  lower-limb joints (knee and/or hip), with potential applicability to the
  development of ankle devices, are also included.%

    This dataset contains leg joint kinematics, kinetics, and EMG activity from
  an experimental protocol approved by the Institutional Review Board at the
  University of Texas at Dallas. Ten able-bodied subjects walked at steady
  speeds and inclines on a Bertec instrumented treadmill for one minute per
  trial. Each subject walked at every combination of the speeds 0.8 m/s, 1.0
  m/s, and 1.2 m/s and inclines from -10 degrees to +10 degrees at 2.5 degree
  increments, for a total of 27 trials. During each trial, a 10-camera Vicon
  motion capture system recorded leg kinematics, while force plates in the
  Bertec treadmill recorded ground reaction forces, and a Delsys Trigno EMG
  system recorded muscle activation of the rectus femoris, biceps femoris,
  tibialis anterior, and gastrocnemius. This data can be used to test many
  hypotheses and models of human locomotion at varying speeds and inclines.
  This kinematic data has been used to train a predictive model that represents
  gait kinematics as a continuous function of gait cycle percentage, speed, and
  incline:~K. Embry, D. Villarreal, R. Macaluso, and R. Gregg, ``Modeling the

    We introduce Adam, an algorithm for first-order gradient-based optimization
  of stochastic objective functions, based on adaptive estimates of lower-order
  moments. The method is straightforward to implement, is computationally
  efficient, has little memory requirements, is invariant to diagonal rescaling
  of the gradients, and is well suited for problems that are large in terms of
  data and/or parameters. The method is also appropriate for non-stationary
  objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. The
  hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little
  tuning. Some connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was inspired,
  are discussed. We also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the
  algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is
  comparable to the best known results under the online convex optimization
  framework. Empirical results demonstrate that Adam works well in practice and
  compares favorably to other stochastic optimization methods. Finally, we
  discuss AdaMax, a variant of Adam based on the infinity norm.%

    There are an infinite number of ways to control an assistive robotic
  device; however, there is little consensus on which ways are better than
  others and why. We designed this study to compare the control of powered
  ankle exoskeletons using neural measurements to drive control versus that
  using mechanically intrinsic measurements. The controller driven by neural
  measurements was a dynamic gain proportional myoelectric controller using
  user's soleus muscle activity for an actuation signal. The controller driven
  by mechanically intrinsic measurements was a timing-based controller using
  detected heel-strikes of the user to appropriately time actuation. We
  designed these two controllers in such a way that both had the same average
  actuation signal and tested them with 8 healthy subjects. Results show no
  significant difference in metabolic work rate between the two controllers.
  Both controllers resulted in reductions in metabolic work rate of 19{\%}
  below walking in the devices unpowered. We found that subjects using the
  timing-based mechanically intrinsic controller exhibited less positive and
  negative total ankle power than when using the dynamic gain proportional
  myoelectric controller. This finding was coupled with a reduction of 11.8{\%}
  in soleus muscle activity. We believe these finding can have large
  implications for applications in rehabilitation and lend insight to when one
  controller is more appropriate to use than another.%

    For the control of actuated orthoses, or gait rehabilitation robotics,
  kinematic reference trajectories are often required. These trajectories,
  consisting of joint angles, angular velocities and accelerations, are highly
  dependent on walking-speed. We present and evaluate a novel method to
  reconstruct body-height and speed-dependent joint trajectories. First, we
  collected gait kinematics in fifteen healthy (middle) aged subjects (47-68),
  at a wide range of walking-speeds (0.5-5 kph). For each joint trajectory
  multiple key-events were selected (among which its extremes). Second, we
  derived regression-models that predict the timing, angle, angular velocity
  and acceleration for each key-event, based on walking-speed and the
  subject׳s body-height. Finally, quintic splines were fitted between the
  predicted key-events to reconstruct a full gait cycle. Regression-models were
  obtained for hip ab-/adduction, hip flexion/extension, knee flexion/extension
  and ankle plantar-/dorsiflexion. Results showed that the majority of the
  key-events were dependent on walking-speed, both in terms of timing and
  amplitude, whereas the body-height had less effect. The reconstructed
  trajectories matched the measured trajectories very well, in terms of angle,
  angular velocity and acceleration. For the angles the RMSE between the
  reconstructed and measured trajectories was 2.6°. The mean correlation
  coefficient between the reconstructed and measured angular trajectories was
  0.91. The method and the data presented in this paper can be used to generate
  speed-dependent gait patterns. These patterns can be used for the control of
  several robotic gait applications. Alternatively they can assist the
  assessment of pathological gait, where they can serve as a reference for
  {\textquotedbl}normal{\textquotedbl} gait.%

    Deep learning allows computational models that are composed of multiple

  abstraction. These methods have dramatically improved the state-of-the-art in
  speech recognition, visual object recognition, object detection and many

  intricate structure in large data sets by using the backpropagation algorithm
  to indicate how a machine should change its internal parameters that are used
  to compute the representation in each layer from the representation in the
  previous layer. Deep convolutional nets have brought about breakthroughs in

    Clinical gait analysis attempts to provide, in a pathological context, an
  objective record that quantifies the magnitude of deviations from normal
  gait. However, the identification of deviations is highly dependent with the
  characteristics of the normative database used. In particular, a mismatch
  between patient characteristics and an asymptomatic population database in
  terms of walking speed, demographic and anthropometric parameters may lead to
  misinterpretation during the clinical process. Rather than developing a new
  normative data repository that may require considerable of resources and
  time, this study aims to assess a method for predicting lower limb sagittal
  kinematics using multiple regression models based on walking speed, gender,
  age and BMI as predictors. With this approach, we were able to predict
  kinematics with an error within 1 standard deviation of the mean of the
  original waveforms recorded on fifty-four participants. Furthermore, the
  proposed approach allowed us to estimate the relative contribution to angular
  variations of each predictor, independently from the others. It appeared that
  a mismatch in walking speed, but also age, sex and BMI may lead to errors
  higher than 5° on lower limb sagittal kinematics and should thus be taken
  into account before any clinical interpretation.%

    Understanding the lower limb kinematic, kinetic, and electromyography (EMG)
  data interrelation in controlled speeds is challenging for fully assessing
  human locomotion conditions. This paper provides a complete dataset with the
  above-mentioned raw and processed data simultaneously recorded for sixteen
  healthy participants walking on a 10 meter-flat surface at seven controlled
  speeds (1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, 3.5, and 4.0 km/h). The raw data include
  3D joint trajectories of 24 retro-reflective markers, ground reaction forces
  (GRF), force plate moments, center of pressures, and EMG signals from
  Tibialis Anterior, Gastrocnemius Lateralis, Biceps Femoris, and Vastus
  Lateralis. The processed data present gait cycle-normalized data including
  filtered EMG signals and their envelope, 3D GRF, joint angles, and torques.
  This study details the experimental setup and presents a brief validation of
  the data quality. The presented dataset may contribute to (i) validate and
  enhance human biomechanical gait models, and (ii) serve as a reference
  trajectory for personalized control of robotic assistive devices, aiming an
  adequate assistance level adjusted to the gait speed and user's
  anthropometry.%

    Deep neural networks have been successfully used in diverse emerging
  domains to solve real world complex problems with may more deep learning(DL)
  architectures, being developed to date. To achieve these state-of-the-art
  performances, the DL architectures use activation functions (AFs), to perform
  diverse computations between the hidden layers and the output layers of any
  given DL architecture. This paper presents a survey on the existing AFs used
  in deep learning applications and highlights the recent trends in the use of
  the activation functions for deep learning applications. The novelty of this
  paper is that it compiles majority of the AFs used in DL and outlines the
  current trends in the applications and usage of these functions in practical
  deep learning deployments against the state-of-the-art research results. This
  compilation will aid in making effective decisions in the choice of the most
  suitable and appropriate activation function for any given application, ready
  for deployment. This paper is timely because most research papers on AF
  highlights similar works and results while this paper will be the first, to
  compile the trends in AF applications in practice against the research
  results from literature, found in deep learning research to date.%

    A momentum term is usually included in the simulations of connectionist
  learning algorithms. Although it is well known that such a term greatly
  improves the speed of learning, there have been few rigorous studies of its
  mechanisms. In this paper, I show that in the limit of continuous time, the
  momentum parameter is analogous to the mass of Newtonian particles that move
  through a viscous medium in a conservative force field. The behavior of the
  system near a local minimum is equivalent to a set of coupled and damped
  harmonic oscillators. The momentum term improves the speed of convergence by
  bringing some eigen components of the system closer to critical damping.
  Similar results can be obtained for the discrete time case used in computer
  simulations. In particular, I derive the bounds for convergence on
  learning-rate and momentum parameters, and demonstrate that the momentum term
  can increase the range of learning rate over which the system converges. The
  optimal condition for convergence is also analyzed.%

    The choice of activation functions in deep networks has a significant
  effect on the training dynamics and task performance. Currently, the most
  successful and widely-used activation function is the Rectified Linear Unit
  (ReLU). Although various hand-designed alternatives to ReLU have been
  proposed, none have managed to replace it due to inconsistent gains. In this
  work, we propose to leverage automatic search techniques to discover new
  activation functions. Using a combination of exhaustive and reinforcement
  learning-based search, we discover multiple novel activation functions. We
  verify the effectiveness of the searches by conducting an empirical
  evaluation with the best discovered activation function. Our experiments show
  that the best discovered activation function, {\$}f(x) = x $\backslash$cdot
  \text{sigmoid}($\backslash$beta x){\$}, which we name Swish, tends to work
  better than ReLU on deeper models across a number of challenging datasets.
  For example, simply replacing ReLUs with Swish units improves top-1
  classification accuracy on ImageNet by 0.9\% for Mobile NASNet-A and 0.6\%
  for Inception-ResNet-v2. The simplicity of Swish and its similarity to ReLU
  make it easy for practitioners to replace ReLUs with Swish units in any
  neural network.%

    Muscle models are the essential components of any musculoskeletal
  simulation. In addition, muscle models which are incorporated in neural-based
  prosthetic and orthotic devices may significantly improve their performance.
  The aim of the study was to compare the performances of two types of muscle
  models in terms of predicting the moments developed at the human elbow joint
  complex based on joint kinematics and neuromuscular activity. The performance
  evaluation of the muscle models was required to implement them in a powered
  myosignal-driven exoskeleton (orthotic device). The experimental setup
  included a passive exoskeleton capable of measuring the joint kinematics and
  dynamics in addition to the muscle myosignal activity (EMG). Two types of
  models were developed and analyzed: (i) a Hill-based model and (ii) a neural
  network. The task, which was selected for evaluating the muscle models
  performance, was the flexion-extension movement of the forearm with a
  hand-held weight. For this task the muscle model inputs were the normalized
  neural activation levels of the four main flexor-extensor muscles of the
  elbow joint, and the elbow joint angle and angular velocity. Using this
  inputs, the muscle model predicted the moment applied on the elbow joint
  during the movement. Results indicated a good performance of the Hill model,
  although the neural network predictions appeared to be superior. Relative
  advantages and shortcomings of both approaches were presented and discussed.%

    This tutorial introduces the reader to Gaussian process regression as an
  expressive tool to model, actively explore and exploit unknown functions.
  Gaussian process regression is a powerful, non-parametric Bayesian approach
  towards regression problems that can be utilized in exploration and
  exploitation scenarios. This tutorial aims to provide an accessible
  introduction to these techniques. We will introduce Gaussian processes which
  generate distributions over functions used for Bayesian non-parametric
  regression, and demonstrate their use in applications and didactic examples
  including simple regression problems, a demonstration of kernel-encoded prior
  assumptions and compositions, a pure exploration scenario within an optimal
  design framework, and a bandit-like exploration--exploitation scenario where
  the goal is to recommend movies. Beyond that, we describe a situation
  modelling risk-averse exploration in which an additional constraint (not to
  sample below a certain threshold) needs to be accounted for. Lastly, we
  summarize recent psychological experiments utilizing Gaussian processes.
  Software and literature pointers are also provided.%

    In this tutorial we give an overview of the basic ideas underlying Support
  Vector (SV) machines for function estimation. Furthermore, we include a
  summary of currently used algorithms for training SV machines, covering both
  the quadratic (or convex) programming part and advanced methods for dealing
  with large datasets. Finally, we mention some modifications and extensions
  that have been applied to the standard SV algorithm, and discuss the aspect
  of regularization from a SV perspective.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    : Technological advancements have led to the development of numerous
  wearable robotic devices for the physical assistance and restoration of human
  locomotion. While many challenges remain with respect to the mechanical
  design of such devices, it is at least equally challenging and important to
  develop strategies to control them in concert with the intentions of the
  user.This work reviews the state-of-the-art techniques for controlling
  portable active lower limb prosthetic and orthotic (P/O) devices in the
  context of locomotive activities of daily living (ADL), and considers how
  these can be interfaced with the user's sensory-motor control system. This
  review underscores the practical challenges and opportunities associated with
  P/O control, which can be used to accelerate future developments in this
  field. Furthermore, this work provides a classification scheme for the
  comparison of the various control strategies.As a novel contribution, a
  general framework for the control of portable gait-assistance devices is
  proposed. This framework accounts for the physical and informatic
  interactions between the controller, the user, the environment, and the
  mechanical device itself. Such a treatment of P/Os--not as independent
  devices, but as actors within an ecosystem--is suggested to be necessary to
  structure the next generation of intelligent and multifunctional
  controllers.Each element of the proposed framework is discussed with respect
  to the role that it plays in the assistance of locomotion, along with how its
  states can be sensed as inputs to the controller. The reviewed controllers
  are shown to fit within different levels of a hierarchical scheme, which
  loosely resembles the structure and functionality of the nominal human
  central nervous system (CNS). Active and passive safety mechanisms are
  considered to be central aspects underlying all of P/O design and control,
  and are shown to be critical for regulatory approval of such devices for
  real-world use.The works discussed herein provide evidence that, while we are
  getting ever closer, significant challenges still exist for the development
  of controllers for portable powered P/O devices that can seamlessly integrate
  with the user's neuromusculoskeletal system and are practical for use in
  locomotive ADL.%

    OBJECTIVE The purpose of this study was to determine the contribution of
  electromyography (EMG) data, in combination with a diverse array of
  mechanical sensors, to locomotion mode intent recognition in transfemoral
  amputees using powered prostheses. Additionally, we determined the effect of
  adding time history information using a dynamic Bayesian network (DBN) for
  both the mechanical and EMG sensors. APPROACH EMG signals from the residual
  limbs of amputees have been proposed to enhance pattern recognition-based
  intent recognition systems for powered lower limb prostheses, but mechanical
  sensors on the prosthesis-such as inertial measurement units, position and
  velocity sensors, and load cells-may be just as useful. EMG and mechanical
  sensor data were collected from 8 transfemoral amputees using a powered
  knee/ankle prosthesis over basic locomotion modes such as walking, slopes and
  stairs. An offline study was conducted to determine the benefit of different
  sensor sets for predicting intent. MAIN RESULTS EMG information was not as
  accurate alone as mechanical sensor information (p {\textless} 0.05) for any
  classification strategy. However, EMG in combination with the mechanical
  sensor data did significantly reduce intent recognition errors (p {\textless}
  0.05) both for transitions between locomotion modes and steady-state
  locomotion. The sensor time history (DBN) classifier significantly reduced
  error rates compared to a linear discriminant classifier for steady-state
  steps, without increasing the transitional error, for both EMG and mechanical
  sensors. Combining EMG and mechanical sensor data with sensor time history
  reduced the average transitional error from 18.4{\%} to 12.2{\%} and the
  average steady-state error from 3.8{\%} to 1.0{\%} when classifying
  level-ground walking, ramps, and stairs in eight transfemoral amputee
  subjects. SIGNIFICANCE These results suggest that a neural interface in
  combination with time history methods for locomotion mode classification can
  enhance intent recognition performance; this strategy should be considered
  for future real-time experiments.%

    We propose a novel methodology for predicting human gait pattern kinematics
  based on a statistical and stochastic approach using a method called Gaussian
  process regression (GPR). We selected 14 body parameters that significantly
  affect the gait pattern and 14 joint motions that represent gait kinematics.
  The body parameter and gait kinematics data were recorded from 113 subjects
  by anthropometric measurements and a motion capture system. We generated a
  regression model with GPR for gait pattern prediction and built a stochastic
  function mapping from body parameters to gait kinematics based on the
  database and GPR, and validated the model with a cross validation method. The
  function can not only produce trajectories for the joint motions associated
  with gait kinematics, but can also estimate the associated uncertainties. Our
  approach results in a novel, low-cost and subject-specific method for
  predicting gait kinematics with only the subject's body parameters as the
  necessary input, and also enables a comprehensive understanding of the
  correlation and uncertainty between body parameters and gait kinematics.%

    We present a novel per-dimension learning rate method for gradient descent
  called ADADELTA. The method dynamically adapts over time using only first
  order information and has minimal computational overhead beyond vanilla
  stochastic gradient descent. The method requires no manual tuning of a
  learning rate and appears robust to noisy gradient information, different
  model architecture choices, various data modalities and selection of
  hyperparameters. We show promising results compared to other methods on the
  MNIST digit classification task using a single machine and on a large scale
  voice dataset in a distributed cluster environment.%
