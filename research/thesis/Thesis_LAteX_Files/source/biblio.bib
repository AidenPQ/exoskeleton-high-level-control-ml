@article{Qian.1999,
 abstract = {A momentum term is usually included in the simulations of connectionist learning algorithms. Although it is well known that such a term greatly improves the speed of learning, there have been few rigorous studies of its mechanisms. In this paper, I show that in the limit of continuous time, the momentum parameter is analogous to the mass of Newtonian particles that move through a viscous medium in a conservative force field. The behavior of the system near a local minimum is equivalent to a set of coupled and damped harmonic oscillators. The momentum term improves the speed of convergence by bringing some eigen components of the system closer to critical damping. Similar results can be obtained for the discrete time case used in computer simulations. In particular, I derive the bounds for convergence on learning-rate and momentum parameters, and demonstrate that the momentum term can increase the range of learning rate over which the system converges. The optimal condition for convergence is also analyzed.},

 abstract = {Deep neural networks have been successfully used in diverse emerging domains to solve real world complex problems with may more deep learning(DL) architectures, being developed to date. To achieve these state-of-the-art performances, the DL architectures use activation functions (AFs), to perform diverse computations between the hidden layers and the output layers of any given DL architecture. This paper presents a survey on the existing AFs used in deep learning applications and highlights the recent trends in the use of the activation functions for deep learning applications. The novelty of this paper is that it compiles majority of the AFs used in DL and outlines the current trends in the applications and usage of these functions in practical deep learning deployments against the state-of-the-art research results. This compilation will aid in making effective decisions in the choice of the most suitable and appropriate activation function for any given application, ready for deployment. This paper is timely because most research papers on AF highlights similar works and results while this paper will be the first, to compile the trends in AF applications in practice against the research results from literature, found in deep learning research to date.},

The processed data present gait cycle-normalized data including filtered EMG signals and their envelope, 3D GRF, joint angles, and torques. This study details the experimental setup and presents a brief validation of the data quality.

@article{Moissenet.2019,
 abstract = {Clinical gait analysis attempts to provide, in a pathological context, an objective record that quantifies the magnitude of deviations from normal gait. However, the identification of deviations is highly dependent with the characteristics of the normative database used. In particular, a mismatch between patient characteristics and an asymptomatic population database in terms of walking speed, demographic and anthropometric parameters may lead to misinterpretation during the clinical process. Rather than developing a new normative data repository that may require considerable of resources and time, this study aims to assess a method for predicting lower limb sagittal kinematics using multiple regression models based on walking speed, gender, age and BMI as predictors. With this approach, we were able to predict kinematics with an error within 1 standard deviation of the mean of the original waveforms recorded on fifty-four participants. Furthermore, the proposed approach allowed us to estimate the relative contribution to angular variations of each predictor, independently from the others. It appeared that a mismatch in walking speed, but also age, sex and BMI may lead to errors higher than 5° on lower limb sagittal kinematics and should thus be taken into account before any clinical interpretation.},

@article{Luo.2023,
 abstract = {BACKGROUND

Few studies have systematically investigated robust controllers for lower limb rehabilitation exoskeletons (LLREs) that can safely and effectively assist users with a variety of neuromuscular disorders to walk with full autonomy. One of the key challenges for developing such a robust controller is to handle different degrees of uncertain human-exoskeleton interaction forces from the patients. Consequently, conventional walking controllers either are patient-condition specific or involve tuning of many control parameters, which could behave unreliably and even fail to maintain balance.

METHODS

We present a novel, deep neural network, reinforcement learning-based robust controller for a LLRE based on a decoupled offline human-exoskeleton simulation training with three independent networks, which aims to provide reliable walking assistance against various and uncertain human-exoskeleton interaction forces. The exoskeleton controller is driven by a neural network control policy that acts on a stream of the LLRE's proprioceptive signals, including joint kinematic states, and subsequently predicts real-time position control targets for the actuated joints. To handle uncertain human interaction forces, the control policy is trained intentionally with an integrated human musculoskeletal model and realistic human-exoskeleton interaction forces. Two other neural networks are connected with the control policy network to predict the interaction forces and muscle coordination. To further increase the robustness of the control policy to different human conditions, we employ domain randomization during training that includes not only randomization of exoskeleton dynamics properties but, more importantly, randomization of human muscle strength to simulate the variability of the patient's disability. Through this decoupled deep reinforcement learning framework, the trained controller of LLREs is able to provide reliable walking assistance to patients~with different degrees of neuromuscular disorders without any control parameter tuning.

RESULTS AND CONCLUSION

A universal, RL-based walking controller is trained and virtually tested on a LLRE system to verify its effectiveness and robustness in assisting users with different disabilities such as passive muscles (quadriplegic), muscle weakness, or hemiplegic conditions without any control parameter tuning. Analysis of the RMSE for joint tracking, CoP-based stability, and gait symmetry shows the effectiveness of the controller. An ablation study also demonstrates the strong robustness of the control policy under large exoskeleton dynamic property ranges and various human-exoskeleton interaction forces. The decoupled network structure allows us to isolate the LLRE control policy network for testing and sim-to-real transfer since it uses only proprioception information of the LLRE (joint sensory state) as the input. Furthermore, the controller is shown to be able to handle different patient conditions without the need for patient-specific control parameter tuning.},

@article{Koopman.2014,
 abstract = {For the control of actuated orthoses, or gait rehabilitation robotics, kinematic reference trajectories are often required. These trajectories, consisting of joint angles, angular velocities and accelerations, are highly dependent on walking-speed. We present and evaluate a novel method to reconstruct body-height and speed-dependent joint trajectories. First, we collected gait kinematics in fifteen healthy (middle) aged subjects (47-68), at a wide range of walking-speeds (0.5-5 kph). For each joint trajectory multiple key-events were selected (among which its extremes). Second, we derived regression-models that predict the timing, angle, angular velocity and acceleration for each key-event, based on walking-speed and the subject׳s body-height. Finally, quintic splines were fitted between the predicted key-events to reconstruct a full gait cycle. Regression-models were obtained for hip ab-/adduction, hip flexion/extension, knee flexion/extension and ankle plantar-/dorsiflexion. Results showed that the majority of the key-events were dependent on walking-speed, both in terms of timing and amplitude, whereas the body-height had less effect. The reconstructed trajectories matched the measured trajectories very well, in terms of angle, angular velocity and acceleration. For the angles the RMSE between the reconstructed and measured trajectories was 2.6°. The mean correlation coefficient between the reconstructed and measured angular trajectories was 0.91. The method and the data presented in this paper can be used to generate speed-dependent gait patterns. These patterns can be used for the control of several robotic gait applications. Alternatively they can assist the assessment of pathological gait, where they can serve as a reference for {\textquotedbl}normal{\textquotedbl} gait.},

@article{Koller.2017,
 abstract = {There are an infinite number of ways to control an assistive robotic device; however, there is little consensus on which ways are better than others and why. We designed this study to compare the control of powered ankle exoskeletons using neural measurements to drive control versus that using mechanically intrinsic measurements. The controller driven by neural measurements was a dynamic gain proportional myoelectric controller using user's soleus muscle activity for an actuation signal. The controller driven by mechanically intrinsic measurements was a timing-based controller using detected heel-strikes of the user to appropriately time actuation. We designed these two controllers in such a way that both had the same average actuation signal and tested them with 8 healthy subjects. Results show no significant difference in metabolic work rate between the two controllers. Both controllers resulted in reductions in metabolic work rate of 19{\%} below walking in the devices unpowered. We found that subjects using the timing-based mechanically intrinsic controller exhibited less positive and negative total ankle power than when using the dynamic gain proportional myoelectric controller. This finding was coupled with a reduction of 11.8{\%} in soleus muscle activity. We believe these finding can have large implications for applications in rehabilitation and lend insight to when one controller is more appropriate to use than another.},

The method is straightforward to implement, is computationally efficient, has little memory requirements, is invariant to diagonal rescaling of the gradients, and is well suited for problems that are large in terms of data and/or parameters. The method is also appropriate for non-stationary objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. The hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little tuning. Some connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was inspired, are discussed. We also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is comparable to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework. Empirical results demonstrate that Adam works well in practice and compares favorably to other stochastic optimization methods.

@article{Keles.2020,
 abstract = {Lower limb amputation is partial or complete removal of the limb due to disease, accident or trauma. Surface electromyograms (sEMG) of a large number of muscles and force sensors have been used to develop control algorithms for lower limb powered prostheses, but there are no commercial sEMG controlled prostheses available to date. Unlike ankle disarticulation, transtibial amputation yields less intact lower leg muscle mass. Therefore, minimizing the use of sEMG muscle sources utilized will make powered prosthesis controller economic, and limiting the use of specifically the lower leg muscles will make it flexible. Presently, we have used healthy population data to (1) test the feasibility of the neural network (NN) approach for developing a powered ankle prosthesis control algorithm that successfully predicts sagittal ankle angle and moment during walking using exclusively sEMG, and (2) rank all muscle combination variations according to their success to determine the economic and flexible NN's. sEMG amplitudes of five lower extremity muscles were used as inputs: the tibialis anterior (TA), medial gastrocnemius (MG), rectus femoris (RF), biceps femoris (BF) and gluteus maximus (GM). A time-delay feed-forward-multilayer-architecture NN algorithm was developed.

The trained NN TA~+~MG was successful (rposition~=~0.952, rmoment~=~0.997) whereas, TA~+~MG~+~BF (rposition~=~0.981, rmoment~=~0.996) and MG~+~BF~+~GM (rposition~=~0.955, rmoment~=~0.995) were distinguished as the economic and flexible variations, respectively.

 abstract = {The choice of activation functions in deep networks has a significant effect on the training dynamics and task performance. Currently, the most successful and widely-used activation function is the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU). Although various hand-designed alternatives to ReLU have been proposed, none have managed to replace it due to inconsistent gains. In this work, we propose to leverage automatic search techniques to discover new activation functions. Using a combination of exhaustive and reinforcement learning-based search, we discover multiple novel activation functions. We verify the effectiveness of the searches by conducting an empirical evaluation with the best discovered activation function. Our experiments show that the best discovered activation function, {\$}f(x) = x $\backslash$cdot \text{sigmoid}($\backslash$beta x){\$}, which we name Swish, tends to work better than ReLU on deeper models across a number of challenging datasets. For example, simply replacing ReLUs with Swish units improves top-1 classification accuracy on ImageNet by 0.9\% for Mobile NASNet-A and 0.6\% for Inception-ResNet-v2. The simplicity of Swish and its similarity to ReLU make it easy for practitioners to replace ReLUs with Swish units in any neural network.},

We selected 14 body parameters that significantly affect the gait pattern and 14 joint motions that represent gait kinematics. The body parameter and gait kinematics data were recorded from 113 subjects by anthropometric measurements and a motion capture system. We generated a regression model with GPR for gait pattern prediction and built a stochastic function mapping from body parameters to gait kinematics based on the database and GPR, and validated the model with a cross validation method. The function can not only produce trajectories for the joint motions associated with gait kinematics, but can also estimate the associated uncertainties. Our approach results in a novel, low-cost and subject-specific method for predicting gait kinematics with only the subject's body parameters as the necessary input, and also enables a comprehensive understanding of the correlation and uncertainty between body parameters and gait kinematics.},

@article{Young.2014,
 abstract = {OBJECTIVE

The purpose of this study was to determine the contribution of electromyography (EMG) data, in combination with a diverse array of mechanical sensors, to locomotion mode intent recognition in transfemoral amputees using powered prostheses. Additionally, we determined the effect of adding time history information using a dynamic Bayesian network (DBN) for both the mechanical and EMG sensors.

APPROACH

EMG signals from the residual limbs of amputees have been proposed to enhance pattern recognition-based intent recognition systems for powered lower limb prostheses, but mechanical sensors on the prosthesis-such as inertial measurement units, position and velocity sensors, and load cells-may be just as useful. EMG and mechanical sensor data were collected from 8 transfemoral amputees using a powered knee/ankle prosthesis over basic locomotion modes such as walking, slopes and stairs. An offline study was conducted to determine the benefit of different sensor sets for predicting intent.

MAIN RESULTS

EMG information was not as accurate alone as mechanical sensor information (p {\textless} 0.05) for any classification strategy. However, EMG in combination with the mechanical sensor data did significantly reduce intent recognition errors (p {\textless} 0.05) both for transitions between locomotion modes and steady-state locomotion. The sensor time history (DBN) classifier significantly reduced error rates compared to a linear discriminant classifier for steady-state steps, without increasing the transitional error, for both EMG and mechanical sensors. Combining EMG and mechanical sensor data with sensor time history reduced the average transitional error from 18.4{\%} to 12.2{\%} and the average steady-state error from 3.8{\%} to 1.0{\%} when classifying level-ground walking, ramps, and stairs in eight transfemoral amputee subjects.

SIGNIFICANCE

These results suggest that a neural interface in combination with time history methods for locomotion mode classification can enhance intent recognition performance; this strategy should be considered for future real-time experiments.},

 abstract = {This paper presents a review on design issues and solutions found in active lower limb prostheses. This review is based on a systematic literature search with a methodical search strategy. The search was carried out across four major technical databases and the retrieved records were screened for their relevance. A total of 21 different active prostheses, including 8 above-knee, 9 below-knee and 4 combined knee-ankle prostheses were identified. While an active prosthesis may help to restore the functional performance of an amputee, the requirements regarding the actuation unit as well as for the control system are high and the development becomes a challenging task. Regarding mechanical design and the actuation unit high force/torque delivery, high efficiency, low size and low weight are conflicting goals. The actuation principle and variable impedance actuators are discussed. The control system is paramount for a {\textquotedbl}natural functioning{\textquotedbl} of the prosthesis. The control system has to enable locomotion and should react to the amputee's intent. For this, multi-level control approaches are reviewed.},

@article{Tucker.2015,
 abstract = {: Technological advancements have led to the development of numerous wearable robotic devices for the physical assistance and restoration of human locomotion. While many challenges remain with respect to the mechanical design of such devices, it is at least equally challenging and important to develop strategies to control them in concert with the intentions of the user.This work reviews the state-of-the-art techniques for controlling portable active lower limb prosthetic and orthotic (P/O) devices in the context of locomotive activities of daily living (ADL), and considers how these can be interfaced with the user's sensory-motor control system. This review underscores the practical challenges and opportunities associated with P/O control, which can be used to accelerate future developments in this field. Furthermore, this work provides a classification scheme for the comparison of the various control strategies.As a novel contribution, a general framework for the control of portable gait-assistance devices is proposed. This framework accounts for the physical and informatic interactions between the controller, the user, the environment, and the mechanical device itself. Such a treatment of P/Os--not as independent devices, but as actors within an ecosystem--is suggested to be necessary to structure the next generation of intelligent and multifunctional controllers.Each element of the proposed framework is discussed with respect to the role that it plays in the assistance of locomotion, along with how its states can be sensed as inputs to the controller. The reviewed controllers are shown to fit within different levels of a hierarchical scheme, which loosely resembles the structure and functionality of the nominal human central nervous system (CNS). Active and passive safety mechanisms are considered to be central aspects underlying all of P/O design and control, and are shown to be critical for regulatory approval of such devices for real-world use.The works discussed herein provide evidence that, while we are getting ever closer, significant challenges still exist for the development of controllers for portable powered P/O devices that can seamlessly integrate with the user's neuromusculoskeletal system and are practical for use in locomotive ADL.},

@article{Sjoberg.1995,
 abstract = {A nonlinear black-box structure for a dynamical system is a model structure that is prepared to describe virtually any nonlinear dynamics. There has been considerable recent interest in this area, with structures based on neural networks, radial basis networks, wavelet networks and hinging hyperplanes, as well as wavelet-transform-based methods and models based on fuzzy sets and fuzzy rules. This paper describes all these approaches in a common framework, from a user's perspective. It focuses on what are the common features in the different approaches, the choices that have to be made and what considerations are relevant for a successful system-identification application of these techniques. It is pointed out that the nonlinear structures can be seen as a concatenation of a mapping form observed data to a regression vector and a nonlinear mapping from the regressor space to the output space. These mappings are discussed separately. The latter mapping is usually formed as a basis function expansion. The basis functions are typically formed from one simple scalar function, which is modified in terms of scale and location. The expansion from the scalar argument to the regressor space is achieved by a radial- or a ridge-type approach. Basic techniques for estimating the parameters in the structures are criterion minimization, as well as two-step procedures, where first the relevant basis functions are determined, using data, and then a linear least-squares step to determine the coordinates of the function approximation. A particular problem is to deal with the large number of potentially necessary parameters. This is handled by making the number of `used' parameters considerably less than the number of `offered' parameters, by regularization, shrinking, pruning or regressor selection.},

We will introduce Gaussian processes which generate distributions over functions used for Bayesian non-parametric regression, and demonstrate their use in applications and didactic examples including simple regression problems, a demonstration of kernel-encoded prior assumptions and compositions, a pure exploration scenario within an optimal design framework, and a bandit-like exploration--exploitation scenario where the goal is to recommend movies.

@article{Rosen.1999,
 abstract = {Muscle models are the essential components of any musculoskeletal simulation. In addition, muscle models which are incorporated in neural-based prosthetic and orthotic devices may significantly improve their performance. The aim of the study was to compare the performances of two types of muscle models in terms of predicting the moments developed at the human elbow joint complex based on joint kinematics and neuromuscular activity. The performance evaluation of the muscle models was required to implement them in a powered myosignal-driven exoskeleton (orthotic device). The experimental setup included a passive exoskeleton capable of measuring the joint kinematics and dynamics in addition to the muscle myosignal activity (EMG). Two types of models were developed and analyzed: (i) a Hill-based model and (ii) a neural network. The task, which was selected for evaluating the muscle models performance, was the flexion-extension movement of the forearm with a hand-held weight. For this task the muscle model inputs were the normalized neural activation levels of the four main flexor-extensor muscles of the elbow joint, and the elbow joint angle and angular velocity. Using this inputs, the muscle model predicted the moment applied on the elbow joint during the movement. Results indicated a good performance of the Hill model, although the neural network predictions appeared to be superior. Relative advantages and shortcomings of both approaches were presented and discussed.},

During each trial, a 10-camera Vicon motion capture system recorded leg kinematics, while force plates in the Bertec treadmill recorded ground reaction forces, and a Delsys Trigno EMG system recorded muscle activation of the rectus femoris, biceps femoris, tibialis anterior, and gastrocnemius. This data can be used to test many hypotheses and models of human locomotion at varying speeds and inclines.

@article{Chehab.2017,
 abstract = {The increased use of gait analysis has raised the need for a better understanding of how walking speed and demographic variations influence asymptomatic gait. Previous analyses mainly reported relationships between subsets of gait features and demographic measures, rendering it difficult to assess whether gait features are affected by walking speed or other demographic measures. The purpose of this study was to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the kinematic and kinetic profiles during ambulation that tests for the effect of walking speed in parallel to the effects of age, sex, and body mass index. This was accomplished by recruiting a population of 121 asymptomatic subjects and analyzing characteristic 3-dimensional kinematic and kinetic features at the ankle, knee, hip, and pelvis during walking trials at slow, normal, and fast speeds. Mixed effects linear regression models were used to identify how each of 78 discrete gait features is affected by variations in walking speed, age, sex, and body mass index. As expected, nearly every feature was associated with variations in walking speed. Several features were also affected by variations in demographic measures, including age affecting sagittal-plane knee kinematics, body mass index affecting sagittal-plane pelvis and hip kinematics, body mass index affecting frontal-plane knee kinematics and kinetics, and sex affecting frontal-plane kinematics at the pelvis, hip, and knee. These results could aid in the design of future studies, as well as clarify how walking speed, age, sex, and body mass index may act as potential confounders in studies with small populations or in populations with insufficient demographic variations for thorough statistical analyses.},

However, they are still lacking an important feature regarding in-hand haptic sensations: the palmar contact. In this paper, we present PalmEx, a novel approach which incorporates palmar force-feedback into exoskeleton gloves to improve the overall grasping sensations and manual haptic interactions in VR. PalmEx's concept is demonstrated through a self-contained hardware system augmenting a hand exoskeleton with an encountered palmar contact interface - physically encountering the users' palm. We build upon current taxonomies to elicit PalmEx's capabilities for both the exploration and manipulation of virtual objects. We first conduct a technical evaluation optimising the delay between the virtual interactions and their physical counterparts. We then empirically evaluate PalmEx's proposed design space in a user study (n=12) to assess the potential of a palmar contact for augmenting an exoskeleton. Results show that PalmEx offers the best rendering capabilities to perform believable grasps in VR. PalmEx highlights the importance of the palmar stimulation, and provides a low-cost solution to augment existing high-end consumer hand exoskeletons.},

@article{Au.2008,
 abstract = {The human ankle varies impedance and delivers net positive work during the stance period of walking. In contrast, commercially available ankle-foot prostheses are passive during stance, causing many clinical problems for transtibial amputees, including non-symmetric gait patterns, higher gait metabolism, and poorer shock absorption. In this investigation, we develop and evaluate a myoelectric-driven, finite state controller for a powered ankle-foot prosthesis that modulates both impedance and power output during stance. The system employs both sensory inputs measured local to the external prosthesis, and myoelectric inputs measured from residual limb muscles. Using local prosthetic sensing, we first develop two finite state controllers to produce biomimetic movement patterns for level-ground and stair-descent gaits. We then employ myoelectric signals as control commands to manage the transition between these finite state controllers. To transition from level-ground to stairs, the amputee flexes the gastrocnemius muscle, triggering the prosthetic ankle to plantar flex at terminal swing, and initiating the stair-descent state machine algorithm. To transition back to level-ground walking, the amputee flexes the tibialis anterior muscle, triggering the ankle to remain dorsiflexed at terminal swing, and initiating the level-ground state machine algorithm. As a preliminary evaluation of clinical efficacy, we test the device on a transtibial amputee with both the proposed controller and a conventional passive-elastic control. We find that the amputee can robustly transition between the finite state controllers through direct muscle activation, allowing rapid transitioning from level-ground to stair walking patterns. Additionally, we find that the proposed finite state controllers result in a more biomimetic ankle response, producing net propulsive work during level-ground walking and greater shock absorption during stair descent. The results of this study highlight the potential of prosthetic leg controllers that exploit neural signals to trigger terrain-appropriate, local prosthetic leg behaviors.},

 abstract = {This work introduces recent supervised machine learning methods such as Gaussian process regression and support vector machines for control of active prosthetic devices and forms a supervisory controller that infers the user's intent. In recent years active prosthetic devices emerged as research area. In comparison to passive devices, active ones mimic the motion of our intact limbs more perfectly. Hence, they overcome several drawbacks a user of a passive devices is confronted with. Examples for benefits caused by switching from a passive to an active prosthesis are a more normal gait and reduced metabolic costs of transport. Even though active devices can improve amputee's every day life, there are still challenges to be solved. Prosthesis control is besides design one of those challenges. The controller needs to decide when and how to adapt active support. Regarding, for instance, the push off phase, the active push off must be aligned with the timing and strength intended by the user. This work introduces recent supervised machine learning methods such as Gaussian process regression and support vector machines for control of active prosthetic devices. The machine learning methods are used to form a supervisory controller that infers the user's intent. As input to the supervisory controller, we use the data obtained by an inertial measurement unit mounted at the shank of the considered active ankle prosthesis. The output or rather the users intent is given by gait, speed and gait percent predictions. If the intent is known, the desired nut position can be determined by a lookup. To enforce the desired trajectory a slave controller, here a PD controller, is applied. The supervisory controller is designed, implemented and tested based on walking and running data recorded on a treadmill. At first, noise free motion capturing data is used to demonstrate the applicability of supervised machine learning methods in context of active ankle control. Afterwards, sensor data obtained with the prosthesis's intertial-measuremt unit is used to proof real-world applicability of the introduced supervisory controller. The obtained supervisory controller is fast and moreover accurate. For gait percent prediction the error is bounded to $\pm$5{\%}. In case of speed and gait prediction, accuracies close to 100{\%} and 95{\%} are achieved, respectively.},

 abstract = {Lower limb amputations impair normal locomotion. This calls for the use of prosthetic devices to restore the lost or disabled functionality. Most of the commercially available prostheses offer only passive assistance with limited capacity. On the other hand, active prostheses may better restore movement, by supporting missing muscle function with additional motor power. The control algorithms of such embedded motors must understand the users locomotive intention to produce the required locomotion similar to that of an able-bodied individual. For individuals with transtibial amputation, the control algorithm should produce the desired locomotion by controlling an active ankle joint to generate appropriate ankle angle and ankle moment. In this paper, a strategy is proposed for the continuous estimation of ankle angle and ankle moment during walking using a support vector regression approach. Experimentally obtained hip and knee joint motion data were provided as the inputs to the support vector regression model. It is shown that, for level ground walking at self-selected speed, the proposed method could predict the ankle angle and moment with high accuracy (mean R2 value of 0.98 for ankle angle and 0.97 for ankle moment).},

 abstract = {OBJECTIVE

Gait impairment reduces a patient's quality of life. Exoskeletons and wearable robotics enable patients with gait disturbance to stand up and walk. An exoskeleton was developed for use in patients with stroke and spinal cord injuries. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of overground exoskeleton-assisted gait training (OEGT) in spine diseases with gait disturbance.

METHODS

This was a single-group preliminary study. Five participants with gait disorders because of root dysfunction accompanying spinal stenosis were included in this study. All participants underwent surgical treatment and an exoskeleton training protocol scheduled for 2 or 3 days per week for 4 weeks. Each session was 60 minutes. Clinical tests were performed before (T1) and at the end of the training (T2).

RESULTS

One patient dropped out of the study because of medical issues that were not associated with the exoskeleton. Exoskeleton-assisted rehabilitation was feasible for all participants. All participants showed positive changes in gait performance, balance, proximal muscle strength, psychological state, and satisfaction with the rehabilitation. However, there was no significant improvement in neurological deficits.

CONCLUSION

OEGT is a feasible rehabilitation method for patients with gait disorders caused by degenerative spinal disease.},

@article{Huang.2023,
 abstract = {Prosthetic discrete controller relies on finite state machines to switch between a set of predefined task-specific controllers. Therefore the prosthesis can only perform a limited number of discrete locomotion tasks and need hours to tune the parameters for each user. In contrast, the continuous controller treats a gait cycle in a unified way. Thus it is expected to better facilitate normative biomechanics by providing a gait predictive model to contribute a non-switching controller that supports a continuum of tasks. Furthermore, a better method is to train a personalized trajectory prediction model suitable for personal characteristics according to personal walking data. This paper proposes a Gaussian process enhanced Fourier series (GPEFS) method to construct a gait prediction model that represents the human locomotion as a continuous function of phase, speed and slope. Firstly the joint trajectories are transformed into the Fourier coefficient space by least square method. Then the relationship between each Fourier coefficient and task input can be learned by multiple Gaussian process regression (GPRs) model respectively. Compared with directly using GPR to fit the joint trajectory under multi task, our method greatly reduces the computational burden, so as to meet the real-time application scenario. In addition, in Fourier coefficient space, the difference in all tasks between the Fourier coefficient of personal data and the one of statistical data follows the same trend. Therefore, a personalized prediction model is built to predict an individual's kinematics over a continuous range of slopes and speeds given only one personalized task at level ground and normal speed. The experimental results show that the gait prediction model and the personalized prediction model are feasible and effective.},

In recent years, these networks have become the state-of-the-art models for a variety of machine learning problems. This has led to a renewed interest in understanding the role and utility of various computational components of typical LSTM variants. In this paper, we present the first large-scale analysis of eight LSTM variants on three representative tasks: speech recognition, handwriting recognition, and polyphonic music modeling. The hyperparameters of all LSTM variants for each task were optimized separately using random search, and their importance was assessed using the powerful functional ANalysis Of VAriance framework. In total, we summarize the results of 5400 experimental runs ( $\approx$ 15 years of CPU time), which makes our study the largest of its kind on LSTM networks. Our results show that none of the variants can improve upon the standard LSTM architecture significantly, and demonstrate the forget gate and the output activation function to be its most critical components. We further observe that the studied hyperparameters are virtually independent and derive guidelines for their efficient adjustment.},

In recent years, there has been an increased interest in the use of exoskeleton technology to reduce rates of WMSDs in industrial worksites. Despite the potential of exoskeletons to mitigate the risks of WMSDs, the required steps to properly assess and implement the technology for industrial applications are not clear. This paper proposes a framework that can help organizations successfully evaluate and adopt industrial exoskeletons. Through a focus group of industry professionals, researchers, and exoskeleton experts, and by building on existing literature, an overarching adoption framework is developed. The identified stages and tasks within the framework enable an organization to evaluate and adopt exoskeletons through a systematic approach and to identify the existing gaps in their technology adoption process. The findings also highlight the areas where further studies are needed to promote the adoption of industrial exoskeletons, including large-scale field studies and long-term monitoring.},

A direct result of this theory gives us tools to model uncertainty with dropout NNs -- extracting information from existing models that has been thrown away so far. This mitigates the problem of representing uncertainty in deep learning without sacrificing either computational complexity or test accuracy. We perform an extensive study of the properties of dropout's uncertainty. Various network architectures and non-linearities are assessed on tasks of regression and classification, using MNIST as an example.

 abstract = {In a typical clinical gait analysis, the gait patterns of pathological individuals are commonly compared with the typically faster, comfortable pace of healthy subjects. However, due to potential bias related to gait speed, this comparison may not be valid. Publicly available gait datasets have failed to address this issue. Therefore, the goal of this study was to present a publicly available dataset of 42 healthy volunteers (24 young adults and 18 older adults) who walked both overground and on a treadmill at a range of gait speeds. Their lower-extremity and pelvis kinematics were measured using a three-dimensional (3D) motion-capture system. The external forces during both overground and treadmill walking were collected using force plates and an instrumented treadmill, respectively. The results include both raw and processed kinematic and kinetic data in different file formats: c3d and ASCII files. In addition, a metadata file is provided that contain demographic and anthropometric data and data related to each file in the dataset. All data are available at Figshare (DOI: 10.6084/m9.figshare.5722711). We foresee several applications of this public dataset, including to examine the influences of speed, age, and environment (overground vs. treadmill) on gait biomechanics, to meet educational needs, and, with the inclusion of additional participants, to use as a normative dataset.},

@article{Farmer.2014,
 abstract = {OBJECTIVE

Powered robotic prostheses create a need for natural-feeling user interfaces and robust control schemes. Here, we examined the ability of a nonlinear autoregressive model to continuously map the kinematics of a transtibial prosthesis and electromyographic (EMG) activity recorded within socket to the future estimates of the prosthetic ankle angle in three transtibial amputees.

APPROACH

Model performance was examined across subjects during level treadmill ambulation as a function of the size of the EMG sampling window and the temporal 'prediction' interval between the EMG/kinematic input and the model's estimate of future ankle angle to characterize the trade-off between model error, sampling window and prediction interval.

MAIN RESULT

Across subjects, deviations in the estimated ankle angle from the actual movement were robust to variations in the EMG sampling window and increased systematically with prediction interval. For prediction intervals up to 150 ms, the average error in the model estimate of ankle angle across the gait cycle was less than 6°. EMG contributions to the model prediction varied across subjects but were consistently localized to the transitions to/from single to double limb support and captured variations from the typical ankle kinematics during level walking.

SIGNIFICANCE

The use of an autoregressive modeling approach to continuously predict joint kinematics using natural residual muscle activity provides opportunities for direct (transparent) control of a prosthetic joint by the user. The model's predictive capability could prove particularly useful for overcoming delays in signal processing and actuation of the prosthesis, providing a more biomimetic ankle response.},

 abstract = {Estimation of joints' trajectories is commonly used in human gait analysis, and in the development of motion planners and high-level controllers for prosthetics, orthotics, exoskeletons and humanoids. Human locomotion is the result of the cooperation between leg joints and limbs. This suggests the existence of underlying relationships between them which lead to a harmonic gait. In this study we aimed to estimate knee and ankle trajectories using thigh and shank angles. To do so, an estimation approach was developed that continuously mapped the inputs to the outputs, which did not require switching rules, speed estimation, gait percent identification or look-up tables. The estimation algorithm was based on a nonlinear auto-regressive model with exogenous inputs. The method was then combined with wavelets theory, and then the two were used in a neural network. To evaluate the estimation performance, three scenarios were developed which used only one source of inputs (i.e., only shank angles or only thigh angles). First, knee angles\textgreek{j}k(outputs) were estimated using thigh angles\textgreek{j}th(inputs). Second, ankle angles\textgreek{j}a(outputs) were estimated using thigh angles\textgreek{j}sh(inputs), and third, the ankle angles were estimated using shank angles (inputs). The proposed approach was investigated for 22 subjects at different walking speeds and the leave-one-subject-out procedure was used for training and testing the estimation algorithm. Average root mean square errors were 3.9°-5.3° and 2.1°-2.3° for knee and ankle angles, respectively. Average mean absolute errors (MAEs) MAEs were 3.2°-4° and 1.7°-1.8°, and average correlation coefficients\textgreek{r}ccwere 0.95-0.98 and 0.94-0.96 for knee and ankle angles, respectively. The limitations and strengths of the proposed approach are discussed in detail and the results are compared with several studies.},

@article{Eslamy.2023,
 abstract = {To reinstate human-like locomotion by using robotic prosthetics, orthotics or exoskeletons, a main challenge is how to coordinate the motion of these devices with that of the biological limbs. One approach to overcome this challenge is to identify firstly the relationships that exist between the kinematics and kinetics of the lower extremity joints and limbs. In this work we aimed to continuously estimate sagittal plane ankle, knee and hip moments using shank or thigh angles. For this purpose, neural network and wavelets were used in a nonlinear auto-regressive model with exogenous inputs. This approach circumvented the need for switching rules or intermediate parameters. To assess the performance of the estimator, four case studies were developed. First, thigh angles (inputs) were used to estimate hip moments (outputs). Second, thigh angles were used to estimate knee moments. Third, ankle moments were estimated using thigh angles, and in the fourth case study, ankle moments were estimated using shank angles. Three different databases involving 106 subjects at different walking speeds were used to evaluate estimation quality. The testing procedure involved both inter-subject and intra-subject evaluations. The best estimation performance was observed when ankle moments were estimated from shank angles. The weakest estimation performance was observed when knee moments were estimated using thigh angles at 0.5 m/s. For this case, the estimation quality was much better at 1.5 m/s. Average RMS errors were 0.13- 0.15, 0.10- 0.13, and 0.09- 0.12 [Nm/kg] for hip, knee and ankle moments, respectively. Average mean absolute errors MAEs were 0.10- 0.11, 0.07- 0.10, and 0.06- 0.08 [Nm/kg] for hip, knee and ankle moments, respectively. Average correlation coefficients were 0.90- 0.98 and 0.98- 0.99 for hip and ankle moment estimations. The value for knee was comparable only at high speed (0.96 for 1.5 m/s), while it was less accurate at slow speed (0.71 for 0.5 m/s). In general, for all of the joints, the estimation accuracy was comparable with that of other studies, although one source of input was employed (either shank or thigh angle).},

@article{Eslamy.2019,
 abstract = {Human gait is the result of a complex and fascinating cooperation between different joints and segments in the lower extremity. This study aims at investigating the existence of this cooperation or the so-called synergy between the shank motion and the ankle motion. One potential use of this synergy is to develop the high level controllers for active foot prostheses/orthoses. The central point in this paper is to develop a high level controller that is able to continuously map shank kinematics (inputs) to ankle angles and torques (outputs). At the same time, it does not require speed determination, gait percent identification, switching rules, and look-up tables. Furthermore, having those targets in mind, an important part of this study is to determine which input type is required to achieve such targets. This should be fulfilled through using minimum number of inputs. To do this, the Gaussian process (GP) regression has been used to estimate the ankle angles and torques for 11 subjects at three walking speeds (0.5, 1, and 1.5 m/s) based on the shank angular velocity and angle. The results show that it is possible to estimate ankle motion based on the shank motion. It was found that the estimation achieved less quality with only shank angular velocity or angle, whereas the aggregated angular velocity and angle resulted in much higher output estimation quality. In addition, the estimation quality was acceptable for the speeds that there was a training procedure before and when it was tested for the untrained speeds, the estimation quality was not as acceptable as before. The pros and cons of the proposed method are investigated at different scenarios.},

@article{Embry.2018,
 abstract = {Powered knee and ankle prostheses can perform a limited number of discrete ambulation tasks. This is largely due to their control architecture, which uses a finite-state machine to select among a set of task-specific controllers. A non-switching controller that supports a continuum of tasks is expected to better facilitate normative biomechanics. This paper introduces a predictive model that represents gait kinematics as a continuous function of gait cycle percentage, speed, and incline. The basis model consists of two parts: basis functions that produce kinematic trajectories over the gait cycle and task functions that smoothly alter the weight of basis functions in response to task. Kinematic data from 10 able-bodied subjects walking at 27 combinations of speed and incline generate training and validation data for this data-driven model. Convex optimization accurately fits the model to experimental data. Automated model order reduction improves predictive abilities by capturing only the most important kinematic changes due to walking tasks. Constraints on a range of motion and jerk ensure the safety and comfort of the user. This model produces a smooth continuum of trajectories over task, an impossibility for finite-state control algorithms. Random sub-sampling validation indicates that basis modeling predicts untrained kinematics more accurately than linear interpolation.},
